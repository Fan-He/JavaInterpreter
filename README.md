# JavaInterpreter

Description: 
------------
This is a Object Oriented, Java-like interpreter. 

The interpreter works like a simplified Java IDE that can process instances, classes, methods/functions, for/while loops, excceptions, try/catch, break/continue. 

The project runs the program in a txt file and returns the output of the main method. 

The project was developed with Racket. 



How to install and run: 
-----------------------
Running the project requires a Racket IDE. 
1. Download the file "Interpreter.rkt", "lex.rkt", and "classParser.rkt". Put all three files under a same folder. 
2. Create a txt file and put it in that folder, and type the program in the txt file. 
3. In the interaction pane, use command: (interpret "filename.txt")
4. The program in filname.txt will be run and the output of the main method will be returned.
